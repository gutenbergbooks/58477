SEQUEL
NOTE.—The Author of “Typee” was more than two years in the South Seas,
after escaping from the valley, as recounted in the last chapter. Some
time after returning home the foregoing narrative was published, though
it was little thought at the time that this would be the means of
revealing the existence of Toby, who had long been given up for lost.
But so it proved. The story of his escape supplies a natural sequel to
the adventure, and as such it is now added to the volume. It was
related to the Author by Toby himself.
